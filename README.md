## TASK-I: 
Problem Statement: Given a video, figure out frames of interest & categories appearing in that micro-batch segment.  

"# Object-Detection-From-Video"

## TASK-II: 
Given an image, detect objects in the frame & predict their category class.  
Since we're free to use any dataset,there exists 2 Problem Statements.   
- Approach-I : Where we can pre-process image, train dataset for multiple images and pass on a test image from Test Dataset which has single object and can predict to which class it belongs.      
**Tech Stack Used**  
-> Model: VGG16 â€“ Convolutional Network for Classification and Detection   
-> Packages: Numpy, PIL, MatplotLib, Pandas, Keras, Tensorflow  
-> Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eb73db_Ib4mk3KjdyY7AvoOy9JyLOkYE?usp=sharing


- Approach-II : We have a data(where there's an image containing multiple objects) and we need to detect what are these objects from a single frame and to which class each belong.  

I've taken both the statements into consideration and tried implementing as per my understanding.
